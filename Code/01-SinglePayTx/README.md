1. Script [createSingle.py](createSingle.py) creates an Algorand address.
    It takes an account name as a command line argument and writes
    the address and the mnemonic and in the ```addr``` and ```mnem``` file,
    respectively.

    The pair of public and private key is generated by invoking

    ```python
        
        privateKey,publicKey=account.generate_account()

    ```

    The public key is called the *address* of the account.
    The private key is binary and is typically stored in the form of 
    a *mnemonic*, a passphrase consisting of 25 english words.

    The mnemonic is obtained by invoking

    ```python

        mnemonic=mnemonic.from_private_key(privateKey)

    ```
